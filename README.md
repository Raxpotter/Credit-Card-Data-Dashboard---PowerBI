This project is a real-time credit card insights dashboard built using PostgreSQL for the backend and Power BI for reporting. The dashboard tracks revenue, customer behavior, and key credit card KPIs.

I built this project by following the concepts taught in Rishabh Mishraâ€™s Power BI tutorials on YouTube, and then added my own ideas for the visuals and measures.
